  # Create and register custom sanitizers to format, sanitiize, obfuscate, etc. the data before it is
  # turned into a test fixture. Regex patterns are used to determine if a column should be passed to a
  # sanitizer. The regex pattern that is tested is Classname.column_name - so if a sanitizer needs to be
  # scoped to a specific class only, simply add the classname to the pattern, for example /User.phone_number/
  # would sanitize the phone_number field for a User but not the phone_number field for a Customer.
